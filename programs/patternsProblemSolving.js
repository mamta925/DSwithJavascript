/*
Frequency Counter Pattern: see frequency like anagram
Multiple Pointers Pattern: creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or  position 
and move towards the beginning end or middle based on a certain condition like sumZero

Sliding Window Approach:  this pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from 
                       one position to another ex: longest unique string

Divide and Conquer: this pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process
                      with a subset of data.
